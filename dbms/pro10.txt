10. Creating a Trigger to Separate and Maintain Credit and Debit Totals
 Problem Definition:
 You are required to create a trigger on the account table that maintains separate credit and debit totals depending on whether the inserted amount is positive or 
negative.
 Table Structures:
 Table: account
 Fields:- acc_no (Integer)- amount (Decimal – up to 10 digits, with 2 decimal places)
 Table: account_summary
 Fields:- total_credit (Decimal) – Sum of all positive (credit) amounts- total_debit (Decimal) – Sum of all negative (debit) amounts
 Tasks to Perform:
 Create the account table.
 Create a new table called account_summary with two fields:
 total_credit (to store the total of all positive amounts)
 total_debit (to store the total of all negative amounts)
 Insert initial values (e.g., 0.00) into both fields of account_summary.
 Create a trigger on the account table that:
 Executes after each INSERT operation.
 Checks if the inserted amount is positive or negative.
 If positive, adds it to total_credit.
 If negative, adds its absolute value to total_debit.
 Insert at least 10 records into the account table with a mix of positive and negative values.
 Observe how the credit and debit totals are maintained automatically.
